# Pyxo

Pyxo is a Tic-Tac-Toe game template project built with Python using the standard Tkinter library for the GUI. This implements some algorithms such as Minimax and heuristic approaches for the game's AI.

#### Future ideas/features to add:

- Two-Player Mode.
- More Customization (ie. choose which symbol to play with...).
